# DataEnrtyApp
  As a task of my internship, this is the third android app (using Java) I created.

## *Task 1:  Modify the app to fetch and display data dynamically.*
  - Create a list or array in the Java code with predefined data.
  - Change the app's logic to fetch and dynamically display data in a ListView.

## *Task 2:  Create an app with a simple form and form submission.*
  -  Create a new activity with a form layout containing input fields (e.g.,name, email).
  -  Add a button to submit the form.
  -  Implement an action (e.g., display a toast) upon form submission.
